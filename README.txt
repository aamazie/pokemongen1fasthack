NOT THE FASEST WAY TO HACK THROUGH, BUT MOST RELIABLE:

1. Give yourself any name, but make sure your rival’s name is “RRRG--”
2. Giving yourself the name “xyvw” should have you encounter all possible MissingNo glitch forms.

8. Avoid all trainers in Forest, collect Potion, and battle one mandatory Weedle trainer and get to level 8.
9. Put your moves in this order, as well as have this many PP per move. Battling Metapod/Kakuna is probably the best option. Make sure to get to level 8 and no higher:

   3. Growl - 36/40
