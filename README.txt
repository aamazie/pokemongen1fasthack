RED/BLUE RBA GUIDE
(Most of this was written by others and not only Aaron Mazie)

**SEE TRAINER-FLY HACK IMAGE MAP TO SEE WHERE TO GLITCH TO CATCH MEW AND OTHERS**

NOT THE FASTEST WAY TO HACK THROUGH, BUT MOST RELIABLE:

1. Give yourself any name, but make sure your rival’s name is “RRRG--”
2. Giving yourself the name “xyvw” should have you encounter all possible MissingNo glitch forms.
3. Collect Potion from PC because you must beat your rival
4. Choose Bulbasaur as your starter
5. Complete Parcel event (Viridian Market) and beat your rival
6. Heading back to Viridian City, battle one of the following options to get to level 7:
   1. One Lv. 4 Rattata
   2. Two Lv. 2/3 Pidgey/Rattata
7. Collect hidden Potion in Viridian (optional)
8. Avoid all trainers in Forest, collect Potion, and battle one mandatory Weedle trainer and get to level 8.
9. Put your moves in this order, as well as have this many PP per move. Battling Metapod/Kakuna is probably the best option. Make sure to get to level 8 and no higher:
   1. Leech Seed - any/10
   2. Tackle - 16/35 *wait until step 10
   3. Growl - 36/40
10. Purchase items so you have a total of 6 unique items, one of which are pokeballs
11. Catch a Pokemon like a Metapod or something and for fun name it Arceus
12. Brock Through Walls / Skywalk
   1. Save before you reach the guy up to the right at the edge of the city who is supposed to take you to the gym so your cursor is on the save because the menu will lock up.
   2. Walk past him and let him talk until you can hit Start and save.
   3. Let him finish and restart when you start walking automatically without him.
   4. When back in the game, get through his text and hold right until you start walking right out of his view a bit.
   5. Switch Bulbasaur and Arceus in your Pokemon lineup.
   6. Walk back to the guy and talk to him on his right.
   7. When he walks away, hold right and you’ll be able to Brock through walls / walk-fly (don't go too far out of bounds or game wil corrupt and you'll have to restart)
   8. Make sure to walk right on first ledge
   9. Head south on the bottom-left tile grass patch to the left of bike shop
   10. Go into Saffron Pokemon Center and heal
13. Head to Celadon City (hold left when talking to the guard and you can skip past him)
14. Go into underground tunnel. Walk up 3 steps and walk over 9 to pick up hidden nugget. Go to Celadon Market to sell it for $5000.
15. Collect Coin Case from the guy in the corner in the diner (make sure Escape Rope is in slot 6)
16. Collect coins in Game Corner and purchase Abra
17. Teleport to Saffron City and deposit Bulbasaur and Arceus into the PC
18. Head to Route 6 and trainer fly (walk into trainer’s view but pause and fly/teleport with Abra before the game notices you)
19. Battle first Karate Guy in the Saffron Dojo.. make him walk to you, though, or the screen will freeze up.
20. Head back south to Route 6 to encounter MissingNo and run away
21. Toss 2 Escape Ropes beforehand to make your count 127 (If you only had 1 it will be at 129 a.k.a. ▓9.)
22. Repeat steps 17-19
23. Encounter second Missingno and run away to get Escape Ropes to 255 (255 is stand-in for CANCEL in game's memory drive)
24. Head into guard house and toss the following items:
   1. Pokeballs
   2. Parlyz Heal
   3. Potion
   4. Antidote
   5. Burn Heal
   6. (Block)2 Escape Rope (Should give you 3 Escape Rope)
25. Merge the 3 Escape Ropes with the ones right below it with select


NOW YOU HAVE THE MAGIC ITEM BAG THAT WILL TAKE YOU TO HYPERSPACE AND GIVE YOU WARPING, SUMMONING, AND OTHER POWERS...

SCROLL DOWN PAST THE BOTTOM MANY TIMES IN THE ITEMS INTO ITEM UNDERFLOW TERRITORY. THIS TERRITORY MAY MAKE IRREVOCABLE CHANGES, SO BE CAUTIOUS IN HOW YOU PROCEED IN HACKING YOUR GAME.


JohnStone's advice:
26. Swap the second slot of Escape Ropes with Master Ball. Toss x1 seaJ two slots above the Escape Ropes (enables instant text). Swap TM 27 with Master Ball x17.

Scroll up past the cancel button, close the menu and walk left once.
30. Swap Mewtwo with Abra. Walk one tile down, then two tiles to the left. Swap TM37 up with Max Potion x1. Walk one tile left, and then one tile down (if playing Red, just go down). Teach TM36 to Mewtwo over Barrier or Recover. Move one tile to the right (don’t do this in Red version). Swap TM37/36 with Master Ball, then swap the same item with HM04, and then one more time down with the Max Potion x1. Battle Giovanni.
31. Battle Giovanni: Psychic Rhyhorn, Swift Dugtrio, Psychic everything else. If you gen 1 miss, use the ether in your bag to restore Psychic.
32. Open bag. Scroll down and swap Master Ball with HM04, then toss (box9) Master Balls (should have 8 now). Swap HM04 with Max Potion. Walk out the door to Cinnabar Island.
33. Stand one tile to the left of the gym, facing to the right/down.  Swap 44yPC up with “money slot”. This is above Escape Rope, which is then above CANCEL. Use CANCEL (press A twice), close out menu. Walk one tile up, and then one tile to the right to enter the gym.
34. Walk one tile to the left and open your bag. Scroll down to Ultra Ball x0 and swap down with Parlyz Heal x1. Swap Master Ball x8 with HM04. Toss 5 Master Balls, then immediately spam B and hold right. Talk to Blaine to Battle.
35. Battle Blaine: Swift Growlithe and Ponyta, Psychic Rapidash. If Ponyta growled you, use Swift on Arcanine, and then use Self-Destruct. If not, just SD.
36. Walk 3 tiles to the right, swap first Escape Rope slot down with “?????”. Use Escape Rope. Walk 3 tiles to your left, use bike to get to Sabrina’s Gym.

37. Stand two tiles above the gym statue, use CANCEL again, scroll down to Master Ball x10 and toss 3 of them. Walk up and reset screen to fight Sabrina. Swift all Pokemon, but Psychic Venomoth. Use CANCEL and walk out of the gym to enter Fuchsia City.

40. Hug the wall until you reach the top left of the gym, toss all but 5 of j. Block4. Scroll down to j. block5 and toss the full stack. Walk over to the tile above Erika and flash screen. Battle Erika. Swift everything.
41. Walk right and exit the gym to enter Vermillion City. Walk to the corner of the dock, and use ????? to Surf and enter the gym. Stand in front of gym guide and use CANCEL.

45. Walk one tile to the left, use CANCEL. Walk down until you’re past the rocks, flash menu, walk in front of the statue, and walk straight down into the Hall of Fame.


Aaron Mazie's advice:
26. Select TM27 X▓7 to swap with Master Ball x17. Toss 109 of those TM27s. Exit the building back north and be in the Hall of Fame. CONGRATULATIONS.
46/27. After game won, fly to Viridian, talk to old man to show you how to catch Pokemon, fly to Cinnabar and surf only along the eastern shoreline to encounter MissingNo versions with Master Balls in 6th slot to get 128 Master Balls to catch any Pokemon you encounter. Do the same with Rare Candies to level up any Pokemon to 100.

In catching all available Pokemon in your version of the game (Red and Blue have different possibilities), using this bit map,
you will have difficulty with the Safari Zone, as it does not allow you to throw Master Balls.
Instead, buy the Safari Balls and walk into the Safari Zone and immediately exit, telling the guard you would like
to leave early. Then, warp to Cinnabar Island and surf along the eastern shoreline as if you were looking for MissingNos
and you'll encounter all the Safari Zone Pokemon and able to throw Master Balls that way.
